Z-Monitor (ZM) is a free tool for monitoring and controlling IEEE 802.15.4 Low Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (LoWPANs).

It provides a convenient solution for researchers and students for developing, debugging and deploying wireless sensor network applications based on LoWPANs.

The tool is compatible with the open-source official TinyOS implementation of the IEEE 802.15.4 recently released by the TinyOS 15.4 WG.
Currently, Z-Monitor is available only for TelosB motes and will soon be extended to a wider range of COTS platforms.
