Z-Monitor has been designed with the following goals in mind:

- For the users:
	+ Providing a LoWPAN protocol analysis tool, open source, free to use, modular and
	  extensible and which is not constrained to the use of any specific sniffer hardware.
	+ Supporting ZigBee and 6LoWPAN protocolsâ€™ packets decoding.
	+ Providing statistical tools for network traffic analysis, to enable live network performance
	  assessment at run-time.
	+ Providing a user-friendly, easy-to-use and interactive Graphical User Interface
	  (GUI), which does not only present decoded packet information to the end-user, but
	  also can be used as a diagnosis tool to promptly detect networking problems and
	  unexpected behaviors.
	+ Being Operating Systems (OS) independent and in particular supporting bothWindows
	  and Unix-based OS.

    Version 3 offers this new capability:
	+ Provide distributed sniffing point capability, to monitor large scale networks
	  widely deployed over sparse geographical areas, using multiple sniffing points, but
	  presenting the results as if the whole network traffic is captured by a single sniffer
	  device.

- For the developer:
Since this release, Z-Monitor becomes open source and new developers are welcome to contribute 
to the development of the future releases.
